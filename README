This program demonstrates how changes performace when you use or don't use goroutines. Also it served me as my little playground to test some stuff. 

On Linux you can build and launch this code by using buildandrun.sh script with a single argument representing how many data you want to generate (Though you still need go installed).
If you're launching this program with very big data size (starting from tens of thousands it will take minutes) it can work really slow (It is O(n^2) algorithm that is launched 14 times).
Note that if you're running this while not having multi-core CPU, goroutines will probably have no positive effect in algorithm work speed, because there is no IO operations in it.
